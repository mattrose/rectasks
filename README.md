# rectasks
Simple Task Manager inspired by vimwiki and password-store.  

* File backend
* infinitely recursive sub-tasks that can easily be moved up the chain.
* comments on tasks 

### Done:

* task list
* list comments for task

### Next up:

* add # of comments to task list
* add command to add comments to a task
* mark task as complete

### Wish list:

* add a command-line flag for opening the task in an editor
* the code is already getting a little copy-paste-y, need to figure this out
* better output formatting 
* set priority
* set Tags
* add date info
